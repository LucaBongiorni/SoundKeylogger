# SoundKeylogger

An experimental project to demonstrate how a user keyboard input may be sniffed through the pattern analysis of the sounds emitted by the keystrokes.

This field of study is called [Acoustic cryptanalysis] and is a type of side channel attack towards electronic devices.

This project was created as an assignment for the [IF754 - Musical Computing] class of 2016.1 at [CIn/UFPE].
